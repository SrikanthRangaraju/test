Hereâ€™s your edited and corrected sentence:

"There are some fixes on the BDS side and also from the Adviser side. After these fixes, when I used the same old data and ran the GET data and Adviser output, the stats are significantly improved, as shown below.

Currently, the TW service is down, so I cannot run a larger dataset for testing. Once the service is up and running, I will try to run it for individual families and post the latest stats."
