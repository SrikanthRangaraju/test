Here is the plan to address the score mismatch for 33 attributes:

I have identified 5 common RUT IDs that span across different families, covering 27 attributes. As the first step, let’s focus on achieving a 100% match for these attributes and IDs by determining whether the issue lies in the Get Data process or on the Adviser side. Please prioritize this task and address it as soon as possible.

Once we achieve the 100% match for the common RUT IDs and attributes mentioned above, we can extend the scope to include individual families with additional RUT IDs to conduct further mismatch analysis.

For now, please note that there are no RUT IDs related to Mail, Email, Directory, or Families. As such, these attributes/families will not be prioritized until we certify the 27 attributes.


I understand there’s an open issue with the "DIR Family segment" from the BDS side. As a workaround, I’ll work with you to implement the necessary changes in the Get Data response via an automation script, so we can proceed with the mismatch analysis without waiting for the BDS fix.

I have uploaded all the relevant details to Teams, including:

Get Data responses
Baseline values
Adviser values
Initial observations
From my initial review, it looks like some of the attributes are matching actual vs. baseline values (i.e., not showing defaulted values, which is a good sign). Once I make the necessary changes in the Get Data response, I will regenerate the Adviser values, generate statistics, and review the results.
