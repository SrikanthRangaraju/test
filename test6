Hi Team,
I know there are a few pending issues from the BDS team, such as:

Chile_bra - "camada" is missing
MCC date format issue
I requested Fanco and his team to load the data into chile_mail/attr_correo, and he is currently checking on that.
In the meantime, I tried to extract the Get data using the current version (with the open issues still unresolved) and generated the adviser values for a few sets. The stats are looking like this:

Once we stabilize these smaller datasets, we can run for 4k/5k or 10k at each family level or by set level.

I have uploaded all the related files on Teams:

Get data
IDS used
Adviser values
Baseline values
Stats/difference files for comparison
Please go through them and let me know your thoughts.
