The latest UAT data files were shared by Ellyn.
Though there were some issues, I applied a workaround and was able to load 40% of the shared data.

I have requested Aswin to create a new instance of Get Data, pointing to the latest schema we created and the data loaded.

I have also shared the valid subject IDs to extract the Get Data and generate the Adviser values.

The expectation for this run is to determine whether the data was successfully loaded for the subject IDs I processed and to assess the performance of the Get Data extraction. Additionally, we need to check for any missing data or segments in the extracted data.
