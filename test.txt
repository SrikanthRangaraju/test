As part of our  performance testing user story, I have been working with the JMeter performance tool to analyze how it handles our regular requests.

As part of this, I have:

Downloaded and set up JMeter.
Added the necessary plugins for gRPC services.
Provided all the required .proto files.
Created a Groovy script to read different/random subject byte arrays from a folder.
Added assertions to validate test cases (pass/fail).
Passed the request to our Calculate service method and initiated the test.
Successfully captured performance metrics.
Attached is a sample output from three different inputs I used. These contain large data files (~3MB each)—which is an unusual case, but useful for testing performance limits.

 – Please review and let me know if this approach works for you.
If you believe kkkkkk data processing is taking too long or that crafting Subject data is a bottleneck, we could try using mmmm data instead. I can provide 200K lllll data for initial testing. This will allow us to get hands-on experience with JMeter, and later, we can extend these tests to the llllll region as well.

I am happy to help set this up on your systems so the team can run additional test scenarios. Once you are comfortable with the setup, you can expand it further.


I am available for a call anytime after 9:00 AM. Let me know if any of your team members would like to discuss further.
