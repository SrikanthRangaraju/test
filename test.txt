Internally, how we handle the mismatch is our responsibility, and we’ll take care of it — no worries. Here's our plan:

a) We'll use the 6 RUT IDs shared by German to extract the GET data response, calculate the adviser values and score, and compare them with the expected results.
b) We’ll use our POC/Batch JUnit test case to read the adviser values from the CSV file, generate the score values, and compare them against the expected score.

Once we’re good with both (a) and (b), we should be all set, Dan."
