As discussed with the Dev team, there is no issue with the "Order and Filter issue." The QA team used a different baseline file, which is why you are seeing an order issue.

The space issue has been resolved.
I have generated the stats for 10k, and they look as follows:

100%: 42
99%: 35
90-98%: 10
0%: 3 (It seems the values are swapped for MONTO and MONTO_D, and there might be a delimiter issue in the Adviser values for FETCHAROTESTO_D).
When I extended the test to 15k, the stats did not look as good. I suspect there might be an issue during the conversion or splitting of the 100k file into 10k or 15k chunks.

I would like to review this one more time and will publish the confirmed and latest stats by the end of the day (EOD). I need one more day to complete testing for the large file.

I will upload the data and share the details with the team.
