Hi Dan,

Sorry, I didn't get a chance to chat or talk to you. Though it’s a bit lengthy, I would like you to please review the details below and share your comments.

I have been discussing with the QA team and Utkarsha, and here is how we are planning for PI 2 as part of the Test Automation initiative:

Priority 1:

Develop a regression suite with both positive and negative test cases for the Calculate service, covering all possible scenarios.

As part of the mismatch process, we plan to use 30K UAT records in on-prem for both live and retro scenarios — for example, validating a template with 1340 attributes to ensure there are no mismatches when changes are made.

We also plan to integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

Priority 2:

Develop an automation batch script in UAT Online API to validate that the results produced by the API (for 30K records) match the batch output, on-prem adviser output, shape output, or expected output.

Priority 3:

We have already started working with Eric and the team on setting up the E2E environment in Cloud QA (with PROD/UAT data loaded).

To achieve this, we may need to develop automation scripts that can run on cloud instances.

I will keep you posted after our meeting this Wednesday.

Priority 4:

Today (04/21) evening, I will work with Nijanth on the Mexico region.

I will coordinate with him to understand his expectations around automation and will update you accordingly.

Please review these priorities and let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions.

Side Note:

I may shorten my planned leave from May 5th–May 23rd to May 5th–May 16th (approximately 10–11 days of vacation).

I had sent you an email on April 9th regarding my leave request. Could you please reply to that email and confirm? I need to inform BBI accordingly.

Additionally, I may take tomorrow off (either the full day or about 4 hours) due to some personal work. Just giving you a heads-up in advance
