We do not have any significant mismatches in the data.
After applying the fixes for RETRO, our stats are looking good and are within the AC range, as confirmed by Felipe.

For the live environment, no code changes were made. As part of regression testing, we compared the mismatches between the old Adviser output and the newly generated Adviser output, and the stats show a 99–100% match.

Additionally, when comparing the latest Adviser output with SHAPE, they are matching and remain within the AC range.

We are now sharing the latest Adviser output with  to run stats for the live environment.

My expectation is that there won’t be any issues in live, and the outputs will match as expected.
