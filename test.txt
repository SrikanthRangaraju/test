We have validated around 100 RUT IDs, including the latest 6 RUT IDs shared by German.
We have extracted the GET data for these RUT IDs, generated both the Adviser values and the Scores.

Out of the 100 IDs, the Scores are matching for 90, which belong to Segment 2 and Segment 3.
The remaining 10 IDs seem to have discrepancies in the GET data response. This may be due to the recent deployment of a new version of NGDL, which could have caused changes in the GET data structure. We are currently checking this with the BDS team.

Additionally, we have verified a few of these IDs in the Cloud DEV environment, and the scores are matching there as expected.
