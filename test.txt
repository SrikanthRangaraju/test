I ran the stats on the larger dataset, and here are the results.
I have uploaded the Get Data, Adviser, and Difference.csv files to Teams.
Franco has loaded data into the aut_family tables for Camada 202011. Now, I need to update the Camada values in the tables and run stats on the remaining attributes.

I think we  should be ready to kick off 346 attributes adviser values  using the available data and analyze the results. To do this I first need to prepare the baseline values for all 346 attributes.

While I work on these baseline values, could you please review the attributes that have a match percentage below 99%.
