As per our commitment for the January 10th deadline, we have successfully conducted the mismatch testing for 10K RUT IDs, and the results are as follows:

We have extended the same testing to 20K RUT IDs, and the updated statistics are as below.
One attribute showing a 50% mismatch is due to a minor fix needed from the development team, which is scheduled to be resolved and deployed by tomorrow.
There are 5-6 attributes for which we are awaiting confirmation from Franco.
For attributes with 90â€“98% accuracy:

We have verified several RUT IDs and are confident that the mismatches are primarily due to the 5-year filtering applied on the Get Data side.
This is not likely an issue with either the Get Data or Adviser sides, as the baseline file provided was from three months ago, while Get Data applies a filter for the last 5 years.
The mismatches appear to be expected, and we believe providing us with an updated expected output file may align the results more closely.
We are continuing to work on and investigate additional attributes with mismatches and will provide detailed reasons for any discrepancies we identify.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
